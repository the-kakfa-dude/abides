/**
 * This is a Singleton Utilities class for doing Database stuff.
 *
 * The pattern used here is the Singleton Holder pattern, which
 * ensures that only one instance of this class ever exists, and
 * that it is constructed lazily.
 *
 * By "lazily" we mean that the singleton object is created the
 * first time some other running code tries to access it.
 *
 * This kind of trick is great for things like your initialization
 * possibly crashing, which you don't want to do during jvm startup,
 * because you get zero debugging info when you crash the loader.
 *
 * However, you need to be careful with deferred initialization because
 * if the singleton's constructor runs for too long, you can get weird
 * timeout problems, often in seemingly unrelated parts of the code.
 * These often look like (or can cause) a stop-the-world garbage
 * collection pause, and have lead to many a wild goose chase.
 *
 * A fix for that situation is to have a startup initializer, that runs
 * through a dependency tree of your resources, and initializes each
 * in turn. You then make sure the resource being set up is not placed
 * into the resource pool, or otherwise announced as available, until
 * _after_ the startup initializer has completed successfully.
